      <p>Hi, my name is Gajendra! I am a high school junior from Bridgewater, NJ.</p>

            <p>During the summers, I like to ride bikes in my neighborhood with friends. It is especially fun in the late evening when it is no longer hot and quite pleasant outside. </p>

            <p>When the weather isn't great, I like to stay inside and find an interesting book to read. Audiobooks or online books are the best because they're much more accessible.</p>

            <p>And, of course, I like to stay up late sometimes, playing video games with my friends. I play on PC and I prefer battle royale games. </p>

      <p>One of the classes I really enjoyed was AP Computer Science Principles. It was a fun first AP class and I learned a lot, not just about how to code, but about computers in general.</p>

      <p>I also liked biology. We did a lot of cool experiments and I had a ton of friends in that class. <a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/FoodSci_p051/cooking-food-science/kimchi-chemistry" target="_blank">Here is the link to the best lab we did!</a> </p>
